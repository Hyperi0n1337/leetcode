## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding skills, algorithms, and data structures. This repository serves as a personal space to document my solutions to LeetCode problems, track progress, and share insights with the community.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a working development environment with your preferred programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++) installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git

3. **Navigate to a Problem Folder**: Each LeetCode problem has its own folder containing a detailed problem statement, solution code, and tests.

4. **Solving Problems**: Open a problem folder, read the problem statement, and work on your solution. Feel free to explore multiple approaches and optimize your code.

5. **Testing**: Test your solution with sample inputs and ensure it works as expected. Create additional test cases if needed.

## Usage
This repository is organized by LeetCode problem. Each problem folder contains the following:
